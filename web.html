    <h4 class="uncentered-header">
        The 3 essential technologies:
    </h4>

    <ul>
        <li><abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr></li>
        <li><abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr></li>

    </ul>

    <h3>HTTP</h3>

    <p class="info-text">
        The <mark>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</mark> (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML</h3>

    <p class="info-text">
        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript. <mark>For more Info click <a href="html.html">here</a>.</mark>
    </p>

    <h3>URL</h3>

    <p class="info-text">URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. <mark>A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web.</mark> In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. Such resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc.</p>

    <h4>The URL Syntax:</h4>

    <p class="info-text">
        A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a string of characters that identifies a resource on the internet and specifies its location. It typically consists of several components, including the protocol <mark>(such as "http://" or "https://")</mark>, the domain name (like "example.com"), and optionally a path to a specific resource on the server ("/page.html"), query parameters (beginning with "?"), and fragments (starting with "#") for navigating within the resource. The syntax generally follows a hierarchical structure, with components separated by specific characters like slashes ("/") and colons (":"). Additionally, URLs can include special characters encoded using percent-encoding to ensure compatibility and proper interpretation by web browsers and servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Web Servers & Clients</h2>

    <h3>Web Servers</h3>

    <p class="info-text">
        A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.
    </p>

    <h3>Web Clients</h3>

    <p class="info-text">
        A web browser is an application for accessing websites and the Internet. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user's screen. Browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. <mark>In 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people have used a browser.</mark>
    </p>

    <h4>How they work:</h4>

    <p class="info-text">
        <mark>The purpose of a web browser is to fetch content from the World Wide Web</mark> or from local storage and display it on a user's device. This process begins when the user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), such as https://en.wikipedia.org/, into the browser. Virtually all URLs are retrieved using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a set of rules for the transfer of data. If the URL uses the secure mode of HTTP (HTTPS), the connection between the browser and the web server is encrypted for the purposes of communications security and information privacy
